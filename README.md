# IMPORTANT

This repo is a fork of the [FW file-validator](https://github.com/naccdata/file-validator). In order to maintain NACC-specific changes with FW, **merge any NACC-specific work to the [nacc-release](https://github.com/naccdata/nacc-file-validator/tree/nacc-release) branch**. FW-specific changes should be synced to main as usual and merged in to the `nacc-release` branch as well.

# file-validator (File Validator)

## Overview

or Flywheel container metadata according to a user provided
JSONSchema file. It can be run at the project, subject, session or acquisition level.

### Outputs

#### Files

none

#### Metadata

Any schema errors identified by the gear will be stored on the file's metadata.
The over-all pass/fail state of the validation will also be stored.

The metadata will be added to the file or container under the file
custom information in the following format:

```yaml
qc:
  file-validator:
    validation:
      state: "PASS"   # or "FAIL" depending on the file validation
      data: [ "<list of error objects>" ]
```

where each error object has the following keys:

```json
{
  "type": "str - will always be 'error' in this gear",
  "code": "str - Type of the error (e.g. MaxLength)",
  "location": "<location object>",
  "flywheel_path": "str – Flywheel path to the container/file",
  "container_id": "str – ID of the source container/file ",
  "value": "str – current value",
  "expected": "str – expected value",
  "message": "str – error message description" 
 }
```


Where value for location will be formatted as such:

For JSON input file:

```
{ “key_path”: "str = the json key that raised the error" }
```

For CSV input file:

```
{ “line”: "int - the row number that raised the error", 
“column_name”: "str - the column name that raised the error" }
```


### Pre-requisites

When validating Flywheel file metadata, file content first need to be parsed. The
[`form-importer`](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/scientific-solutions/gears/form-importer)
gear can be used to parse the file content and add it to the file metadata.

## Usage

### Description

This gear can be used to validate different file content and extracted file metadata
against a JSONSchema. The JSONSchema file can be provided as a gear input and much
easier describe the content of the file or the metadata of the file and optionally
its parent container. The gear can be triggered automatically through gear rule
when configured as such or be used as part of a validation pipeline.

**Supported Filetypes**: Json, Csv.


#### Validation steps:

##### JSON:
For a json file there are two validation checks that are done:
1. Empty File Validation - checks to see if the file is empty
2. Schema validation - applies the schema directly to the file

##### CSV:
For a csv file, two validation checks are performed:
1. Empty File Validation - checks to see if the file is empty.
2. Header Validation - Checks to see that a header is present, AND if the header 
has any extra columns NOT specified in the schema.
3. Schema Validation - Each row is turned into a json object with
`key:value` pairs, where the key comes from the column headers, and the values
come from the cells in the given row. Each row is then validated against the
schema.

#### Typing for CSV
CSVs are inherently untyped, so the exact type of each column must be provided 
in the jsonschema file. By default, python will read everything as a string, 
including blank spaces, which get read as an empty string (`''`). We then use 
default python casting rules to attempt to cast these values to specified types.
Because of the complications of determining a true intended type on an untyped 
list of string, we do NOT allow columns to be multiple types. This means that 
in your jsonschema, a property's `type` can NOT be a list of types. 

Not allowed:
` "INVALID_property": {"type": ["integer", "bool"] }`

Nulls are handled in the following way: If a row has a blank cell, that value
is treated as null, and
is removed from the row dictionary for validation. This does not modify the
original data in any way, just the data that's passed to the validator. 

This way, if that cell was required, the schema will catch it as a missing 
vaule, but if it was optional, the schema will pass as intended.

Here is a list of considerations when setting types for CSV:
1. If a column is a REQUIRED property, that every row MUST have a value for,
then only ONE type is allowed to be specified for that column.
2. If a column is an OPTIONAL property, that some rows may have no value for it.
3. The use of two or more types for a column is NEVER allowed in any case.
4. Casting is done using python's built in type casting. Json types and python
types aren't perfectly aligned, but we have assigned the following conversions:

| JSON    | Python |
|---------|--------|
| string  | str    |
| number  | float  |
| integer | int    |
| boolean | bool   |
| null    | None   |

5. If your data has a custom null value ("NA", "None", etc), then you will need
to modify your schema to account for this in the following way:
   1. any "optional" fields must have something like this to allow a custom
   "null" value:
```json
   {
    "anyOf": [
    {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 10
    },
    {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [
        "null",
        "NA"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


6. All data is initially read in as string. This is important for casting in 
python for the following reasons:
   - Python sees ANY string of ANY value as "true" when you try
   to cast the string to a boolean. Only the empty string `''` is recognized as
   `False` in python. This can lead to confusing behavior, for example:
    ```python
    bool("FALSE")
    >>> True
    ```

   - Python will convert an integer to a float if it's a string. Technically this
     aligns with javascript's type definition anyways, as "number" means either an 
     int or a float, but it is important to be aware that a column with type "number"
     will convert `"123"` to `123.0`:

    ```python
    float("123")
    >>> 123.0
    ```

The chart below shows the various casting results from different strings
that might be read in, to different types. 

| value        | int(value)   | float(value) | bool(value) | `str(value)` |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| "123"        | 123          | 123.0        | `True`     | "123"        |
| "12.3"       | `ValueError` | 12.3         | `True`     | "12.3"       |
| "any string" | `ValueError` | `ValueError` | `True`     | "any string" |
| ""           | `ValueError`  | `ValueError`  | `False`    | ""           |






#### File Specifications

This section contains specifications on any input files that the gear may need

##### *input_file*

The input file content or metadata extracted from the file will be validated against
against the JSONSchema

##### *validation_schema*

The JSONSchema to use to validate the file and/or container metadata must be provided
as a gear input and much easier describe the content of the file or the metadata 
extracted. The file content must be a valid JSON following the [JSONSchema](https://json-schema.org/) standard.

For example, if the `input_file` is a JSON with the following content:

```json
{
    "KeyA": "Some-Value"
}
```
and the following JSONSchema is used:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$comment": "JSON Schema for my file",
  "$id": "MyID",
  "title": "MyTitle",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["MyKey"],
  "definitions": {
    "MyKey": {
      "type": "string",
      "maxLength": 4
    }
  },
  "properties": {
    "MyKey": {
      "$ref": "#/definitions/MyKey"
    }
  }
}
```

The gear will validate the content of the `input_file` and generates a report 
of any validation errors it finds. The report is saved on the metadata.
